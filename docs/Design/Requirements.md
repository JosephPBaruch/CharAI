# Project Requirements

## State the desired function(s) of the system. What is it required to do?

## Define ALL of the required inputs and outputs for the system.
- Software (logic, user interface, etc.)

## Outline ALL of the operating environment considerations. Define any limitations, such as:
- Are there only limited types of materials which can be used for the device?
- Does the device need to have a specific finish (e.g. painted, galvanized, coated, etc.)?
- Does the device need to be dust- or waterproof? If so, how much is ingress is allowed?
- Does the system have any specific ergonomic requirements, such as:
- Limited force a human operator can apply
- A certain height or position of operator interfaces making them easy to use

## Identify and estimate any customer expectations for the product:
- What is the target reliability for the complete system (quantify in % or MTBF)?
- What is the target useful life (i.e. durability) for the product (typically in hours)?
- How much do you think a customer would pay for the product (i.e. target price or cost)?
