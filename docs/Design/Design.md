Where do we want to put biochar?

- Is it based on the yield?
- 


What is the return on investment formula for applying biochar to a location? 
- Quantify for the entire field
- Optimization function 

ROI = time it takes to pay for costs of 

biochar cost, base crop, added crop revenue

base crop + added crop revenue = Total revenue

total biochar cost - added crop revenue -> Once this equals 0 (how long this takes is )
