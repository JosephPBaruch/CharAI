# 🌱 AI for Agriculture

A full-stack web application built to support **precision agriculture** in the Palouse region and beyond. This project helps farmers optimize their use of **biochar** by combining on-farm yield data with public datasets (soil, weather, elevation) to generate actionable **prescription maps** powered by AI.

## Project Overview
Traditional unirrigated hill farming in the Pacific Northwest faces challenges such as:
- Highly variable terrain
- Differences in water availability and snow accumulation
- Topsoil erosion on slopes  

This USDA-funded project explores how **biochar** can improve long-term soil productivity and farmer ROI. Our web application provides a data-driven decision support tool to make biochar adoption practical and profitable.
